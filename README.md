**Equinox** is a surreal, dystopian, sci-fi-themed conworld project set in the year 2597. Earth has entered the astrological Age of Aquarius, ushering in a new era of technological advancement. Mass migration to the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting dissolution of governments in the uninhabitable regions led to the formation of a Plutocratic Socialist global governing body known as the Sixfold Directorate.
